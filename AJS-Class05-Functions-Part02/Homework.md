# Homework - Functions - Part 2

## There is a JSON file with students. Make a call to the file and get the following data from it:

1. Return an array that will display only student's first name and last name as a string
2. All students sorted by the averageGrade property (ascending)
3. All students with an average grade higher than 3
4. All female student names with an average grade of 5
5. All male student full names who live in Skopje and are over 18 years old
6. The average grades of all female students over the age of 24
7. All male students with a name starting with B and average grade over 2

**Note:**

An alternative to making an api call is to copy the students, convert the JASON into valid JavaScript array of objects, paste it in the script and work directly with the data.
